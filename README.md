# redis-server-python
### Requirements:
- Python version 3.11.7 (Python 3.11 and above should work)
- `redis-cli` installed to benchmark and compare with the performance of this redis server
### Command to start server:
`python3 -m src`
### Command to start client node (works like redis-cli):
`python3 -m src.cli`
### Command to run unit tests:
`python3 -m pytest -s tests`
